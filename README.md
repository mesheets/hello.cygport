GNU Hello Cygwin Cygport Package
================================
An example Cygwin Cygport package based on
[GNU Hello](https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/).

About GNU Hello
---------------
The GNU Hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.
It allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
otherwise be unavailable to them.

Seriously, though: this is an example of doing a basic Cygwin Cygport package.
It is the Cygwin version of the GNU Project’s “hello world” program
(which is itself an example for the GNU Project).

About the Cygwin Cygport Workflow Template
------------------------------------------
The [Cygwin Cygport Workflow Template](https://github.com/mesheets/Cygport-Workflow-Template)
is designed to automatically generate
[Cygwin Cygport packages](https://cygwin.com/packaging-contributors-guide.html)
for `*.cygport` file(s) included in the repository.
